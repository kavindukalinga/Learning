## Values scope

In Helm, values can be accessed using the dot (.) notation. The tree starts with the outermost dot followed by the child values.

## The `.Values` set

For example, all values that are supplied to the chart both through the values file and through the `--set` command line flag can be accessed through `.Values` prefix. So, if you run

```bash
helm install myapp01 myapp /path/to/myapp --set service.port.http=8080 
```

Then inside the templates you can access the port using the `{{ .Values.service.port.http }}`

## Other built-in objects

Helm provides you with other values in addition to the ones provided through the values file and/or the `--set` flag. Notice that all built-in object names start with capital letters (unlike the `.Values` set which matches the case state of the value name)  
For example:

- `.Release` : provides useful information about the release data. For example, `.Release.Name` outputs the name chosen for the release.

- `.Capabilities` : it provides information about the environment where the chart is to be deployed. For example, `.Capabilites.KubeVersion` gives the Kubernetes version.

- `.Chart` : all the information that can be found in the `Chart.yaml` file can be accessed using the `.Chart` prefix. For example, `.Chart.Name` for the chart's name.

- `.Files` : provides useful functions to access files and directories in the chart root directory:
  - `.Files.Get` reads and outputs the contents of the file that is passed to it. For example, `{{ .Files.Get "myfile.json" }}`

  - `Files.Glob` enumerates the files and directories from the path passed to it as an arguments. For example, `Files.Glob config/*`. Notice that this function does not read the `files`, it only returns a files object that can be further processed by other functions.

  - `.AsConfig` : works on the `files` object (see previous bullet point) to add the files to the ConfigMap in suitable format.

  - `.AsSecrets` : same as `.AsConfig` but embeds the files in the Secret format. It also encodes them automatically to base64.

You can find a list of Helm built-in objects in the official documentation: <https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/builtin_objects/#helm>

## Templates playground

The `NOTES.txt` file is normally used to output a help message to the user after the chart is installed or upgraded. But, since it is also rendered by Helm during execution, it can be used to test templates output. The advantage of using `NOTES.txt` over other templates is that the generated output is not sent to Kubernetes API for validation. This allows you to check for hard-to-find errors in your templates code more easily.

Whenever you want to see the `NOTES.txt` and other generated templates from Helm without actually applying the result to Kubernetes, you can use the `--dry-run` command line flag. For example:

```bash
helm install myapp01 . --dry-run /path/to/chart
```

## Template functions

Helm uses the Go programming language as a template engine. Go already has a number of functions that can be used in templates. Helm also makes use of the [Sprig library](https://masterminds.github.io/sprig/), which offers over 100 function to augment what Go already provides.

Helm functions are used differently than in other programming language. The function is written as follows:

`{{ function_name arg1 arg2 ...etc }}`

Functions can also accept their input through the pipe symbol (|). For example:

`{{ function1 arg | function2 }}`

Some of the important functions that you will find (and use) a lot in your templates are:

- `-`: the dash is used to remove whitespaces (including newlines) from before or after the output depending on its position:

  - `{{- .Value.resources }}` removes all whitespaces (spaces and newlines) that come before the output.

  - `{{ .Values.resources -}}` removes all whitespaces (spaces and newlines) that come after the output.

  - `{{- .Values.resources -}}` removes all whitespaces before and after the output.

- `toYaml`: accepts an object as its first parameter and converts it to valid Yaml. For example:

`{{ .Values.resources | toYAML }}`

Here, `.Values.resources` is a Go object of type `map`. The function converts it to YAML format that can be used in a Kubernetes manifest.

- `indent`: indents whatever text passed to it by the number of whitespaces passed to it as an argument. For example:

`{{ .Values.resources | toYaml | indent 4 }}`

Here the indent function accepts the output of the `toYAML` function and indents it by four whitespaces.

- `nindent`: does the same task as `indent` but adds a new line character at the start of the indented block. It's often used with the `toYAML` function.

- `b64enc` : encodes its input to base64 format. Useful for being used in Secrets.

## Flow control with if conditionals

You can instruct Helm to take decisions based on one or more conditions using the if keyword.

It works as follows:

```bash
{{- if condition }}
{{ some action if the condition is true }}
{{- else if another condition }}
{{ some other action }}
{{- else }}
{{ if both of the above conditions are false, execute this one }}
```

`if` uses a number of functions that allow it to test for conditions. All functions accept their parameters on the same line separated by speaces:

- `eq` equal to

- `ne` not equal to

- `gt` greater than

- `lt` less than

- `ge` greater than or equal

- `le` less than or equal

- `not` reverses the condition of its argument (`true` returns `false` and `false` returns `true`)

- `and` returns `true` if both of its arguments are true

- `or` returns `true` if any of its arguments is true

- `fail` stops chart execution and prints its argument as a friendly message to the user

## Looping with range

The `range` keyword allows to loop over a list or a dictionary (or a mix of both) of values. For example:

Given our values file containing the following:

```bash
drinks:
  - coffee
  - tea
  - soda
drinkTypes:
  - name: coffee
    type: hot
  - name: tea
    type: hot
  - name: soda
    type: cold
myDrink:
  morning: coffee
  noon: tea
  evening: soda
{{- range .Values.drinks -}}
{{ . }}
{{- end }}
```

Returns
> coffee
> tea
> soda

And

```bash
{{- range .Values.drink-types -}}
{{ printf "The drink name is %s and its type is %s" .name .type  }}
{{- end}}
```

Returns
> The drink name is coffee and its type is hot
> The drink name is tea and its type is hot
> The drink name is soda and its type is cold

Finally

```bash
{{ range $k,$v := .Values.myDrink }}
{{ printf "In the %s I drink %s." $k $v  }}
{{- end}}
```

Returns
> In the evening I drink soda.
> In the morning I drink coffee.
> In the noon I drink tea.

Notice the following:

1. The `range` keyword limits the scope inside its block to the list's scope. So, in a list of `drinks`, the . refers directly to the list item. It becomes the root scope. If that list item has child properties of its own, then we can use the . notation to access them. For example `.name` refers to the name of the currently looped-upon item in the `.Values.drinkTypes` list.

2. When iterating over a map (dictionary), we use the `$k` and `$v` variables (names are not important), which are populated with the key and value of the item in the map.

## Named templates

Named templates can be thought of as global functions that can be called anywhere in the chart to execute repetitive logic. They are placed in the `_helpers.tpl` file.

It is highly recommended that you prefix the named template name with the chart name so that no naming collisions occur when using sub charts that happen to use the same names for its own named templates.

A named template starts with the keyword `define` and end with the end one.

They are called in other templates using the `include` function. For example:

`{{ include myapp.fullname . }}`

The `include` function accepts the first parameter as the name of the named template to call. The second one is the data object that it can use. If we pass `.` then the named template has access to all the values passed to the chart (`.Values`, `.Release`, etc.)
