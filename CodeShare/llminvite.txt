Hey Chandrasiri -- I found your repo Flight-booking-Chatbot while searching for projects building on OpenAI, and got your email from your GitHub profile. 

I'm part of an online program called Backdrop Build, an async 4-week online program for AI builders like you. With support from partners like AWS, Coinbase, and Stability.ai, it's free. At the end of 4 weeks, we distribute $50,000+ in grants to the best projects to help them keep building. 

If interested, you can learn more and apply here: https://backdropbuild.com. You can also check out recent launches here: https://twitter.com/withBackdrop/status/1770378492376478138.

If you decide to apply, shoot me a quick message so I can keep an eye out for your application.

Happy to answer questions, too-- just hit reply!

Cheers,
rapha from backdrop
